<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>Variables are used to store information. <br>
<br>We can use variables to store input from the user<br>
<br>The syntax for getting user input and storing it in a variable is:<br>
<code>variableName = input('stuff that you want')</code><br>
e.g. to ask a user for their name <br>
    <code>name = input('please enter your name')</code><br>
We can give variables any name we like but it is useful to give variables logical names.</p>

<p>We can join what is in the variable using the <strong>+</strong> sign <br>
e.g. using the name variable from the previous example <br>
<code>print('hello '+ name)</code></p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>write the correct code so that whatever the user types in as year gets diplayed <br>
An example of the output is shown below
