<h1>Import</h1>
<p>It is useful to use other peoples code so we can focus on solving our problems
without having to invent everything ourselves <br>
<br>The <code>import</code> command imports a module with someone elses code</p>

<p>The example to the left imports the random module so that we can get random numbers. To use the randint command from
the random module we need the following syntax:
<br><code>random.randint(1,6)</code><br>
This generates a random number between 1 and 6</p>

<p>Try changing line 5 of the code so that we can get a 12 sided die</p>
