<h1>Print</h1>
<p>The print function is used to display text on the screen <br>
<br>Python (and other programming languages) have rules in how you write things so that the computer will understand it.
This is called <em>syntax.</em><br>
<br>The syntax for the print function is as follows:<br>
<code>print('stuff that you want on the screen')</code></p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The traditional first program that programmers write
is displaying Hello, World on the screen.<br><br>
At the moment the code to the left will display <code>Goodbye, World!</code>
on the screen. <br><br>
<strong>You need to:
</strong>
<ul><li>Modify the program so that <code>Hello, World!</code> will be displayed on the screen</li></ul></p>
